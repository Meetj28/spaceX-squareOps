## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```bash
src/
  app/                # Next.js app router pages
    page.tsx          # Homepage (launch list, filters)
    launches/[id]/    # Mission details

  context/            # Favorites context
  __tests__/          # Unit & integration tests
```

## ToDOs

1) Standardize Tailwind CSS usage by defining a semantic color palette (primary, secondary, success, warning, error, neutral), adopting a consistent spacing scale (4px grid), setting up a clear typography hierarchy (body, headings, labels), and unifying design tokens for border radius, shadows, and breakpoints.
2) Add dark mode toggle with Tailwindâ€™s theme support.
3) Improve mobile responsiveness for small screens.
4) Refactor API calls into a dedicated service layer (instead of fetching directly inside components).
5) Increase test coverage for edge cases (API error states, empty data, etc.).
6) Instead of directly removing the launches from the favourites, can add one Modal showing "Are you sure, you want to remove from the favourites", along with the Yes and No button.

## Limitations

1) Limited Offline Support â€“ The app does not currently work offline or with cached data.
2) Performance Optimization â€“ Basic optimizations are in place, but large datasets (many launches) may cause slower rendering.
3) No Authentication â€“ Currently a public-facing app with no user login or role-based access control.
